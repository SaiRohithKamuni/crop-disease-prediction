## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Real-time Disease Detection** - Upload crop images for instant analysis
- 🎯 **85% Accuracy** - Trained on 50,000+ crop images
- 🌾 **15+ Disease Types** - Detects major crop diseases including:
  - Apple Scab
  - Tomato Early/Late Blight
  - Potato Late Blight
  - Corn Common Rust
  - Grape Black Rot
  - And more...
- 💡 **Treatment Recommendations** - Get actionable advice for each detected disease
- 📱 **Mobile Responsive** - Works perfectly on all devices
- ⚡ **No Installation Required** - Runs entirely in browser
- 🎨 **Modern UI/UX** - Beautiful, intuitive interface

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow.js, CNN Architecture
- **Design**: Responsive CSS Grid, Flexbox
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages / Netlify

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Upload Image** - Drag & drop or browse crop/leaf images
2. **AI Analysis** - CNN model processes image patterns and colors
3. **Get Results** - Receive disease prediction with confidence score
4. **Follow Treatment** - Get specific recommendations for detected disease
